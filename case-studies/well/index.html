   <h1>Essential Pharmacy</h1>
   <p><a class="link-color" href="https://www.well.co.uk/">Well</a> has 760 pharmacies making them the third largest pharmacy chain in the UK.</p>
   <p>  Their service model is based chiefly on dispensing NHS prescriptions.</p>
   <p>  Well set a strategic goal to transform their pharmacies through service design. Working with a pilot store, success would be measured by efficiency and growth.</p>

   <h2>Discovery</h2>
   <p>I set up a <a class="link-color" href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-discovery-phase-works" >Discovery phase</a> to analyse the prescription process and find evidence that highlighted key problems within the service. I also did user research to challenge assumptions about customer segments and identify user needs.</p>
   
   <ul>
    <li>I met with the <a class="link-color" href="https://blog.nhsbsa.net/">NHS Business Service Authority </a> and observed how prescriptions are processed</li>
    <li>I visited the main warehouses to see how stock was managed using the latest robotic machines</li>
    <li>I spent time shadowing colleagues in-store to empathise with their experience as key enablers in the service journey</li>
    <li>I created service maps of the end-to-end service journeys</li>
  </ul>

  </div>

   <p class="list-margin">Findings included:</p>
   <ul >
    <li>13% of the pharmacy floor space was allocated to the dispensary, meanwhile dispensing prescriptions accounted for over 90% of the revenue</li>
    <li>There were bottlenecks in the process of dispensing prescriptions, meaning that some customers were waiting for over 15 minutes</li>
    <li>The average time to dispense a prescription was 7 minutes</li>
    <li>Dispensed medication was often un-collected for weeks, with over 200 bags on the shelves at a time</li>
    <li>When customers came to collect their medication it was difficult for staff to find their bag in the dispensary - they call this 'the pantomime'</li>
    <li>82% of prescriptions are free repeat customers</li>
    <li>Popular medication regularly went out of stock so customers would go to another pharmacy</li>
  </ul>

   <p>The discoveries formed hypotheses to test in the <a class="link-color" href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery/how-the-alpha-phase-works">Alpha phase</a>.</p>
   
   <h2>Alpha</h2>
   <p>We set up a cross-functional agile team to design, prototype and test hypotheses that could be delivered into a pilot store. </p>
   <p>The team included a lean-consultant, delivery manager, developer, interaction designer, a pharmacist, and myself as a service designer and user researcher.</p>

   <h2>Service are co-produced</h2>
   <p>I started the Alpha phase by getting the team to carry out service safaris and observe all the aspects of a service eg. the service offering, the touchpoints, the channels, the products. </p>
   <p>Then I ran co-design sketching workshops with the store team to learn about their value systems and how they act as enablers of the service.</p>

  <h2>Prescription collection service</h2>
  <p>  Based on the user needs identified during discovery we defined a number of stages that formed our first digital prototype that would remind repeat prescription customers that their medication was ready to collect.</p>

      <img src="/images/well/05-prototype-stages.png" alt="workshop image" >
    </div>
  </div> 
  <p>  I worked with my team to create a number of service blueprints so that the prototype truly worked through the technology stack.</p>
  
  <div class="image-wrapper">

  </div>

  <p>  We prototyped a new end-to-end prescription collection service that we delivered as an MVP into the pharmacy store.</p>
  <p>  Once we created our MVP prototype we set up a “mock-shop” pharmacy to work with the store team to iterate on the design and observe how the service played out in real scenarios. </p>

<h2>  Actors who enable the service</h2>
<p>I worked with a lean consultant to deliver a new <a class="link-color" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ciJckWCMvpA">one-piece-flow</a> process that enabled the team in the dispensary to process prescriptions in two and a half minutes rather than seven.</p>

</div>

<h2>Physical prototype</h2>
<p>It was also clear that the physical environment wasn't working effectively for staff and wasn't a good experience for customers so we partnered with <a class="link-color" href="https://weareyourstudio.com/">Your Studio</a> who specialise in interior design.</p>
<p>All the designs we rationalised using observations from discovery research and our one-piece-flow process for dispensing. </p>

<h2>Outcomes</h2>
<p>We delivered a new service journey for the pilot pharmacy that included a new interior with custom made stations to enable more efficient dispensing. Dispensing time was reduced by an average of 5 minutes and accuracy increased. It was made possible to track bags of dispensed medication in the dispensary using our prototype and existing pharmacy hardware. The prescription collection service went into a private Beta phase and has real patients signed up to the trial. The successful project was featured in <a class="link-color" href="https://www.chemistanddruggist.co.uk/feature/essential-pharmacy-branch-key-wells-future">industry magazines</a> and nominated for <a class="link-color" href="https://www.chemistanddruggist.co.uk/awards/winners-2019">several awards</a>.</p>
