   <h1>Teachers student loan reimbursement service</h1>
   <p>Department for Education is a ministerial department, responsible for childrenâ€™s services and education, including early years, schools, higher and further education policy, apprenticeships and wider skills in England.</p>
   <p>They needed to build a service that delivered a policy commitment to reimburse teachers' student loans for secondary school teachers who teach languages, science and computing.</p>
  
   <h2>Alpha</h2>
   <p>DfE uses the <a class="link-color" href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile-delivery">Government Digital Service</a> model for phases of an agile project.</p>
   <p>A team was formed to deliver an Alpha phase in 12 weeks. The goal was to prototype the first version of the end-to-end service.</p>
   <p>I divided my time between service design and user research.</p>
  
   <h2>User Research</h2>
   <p>Working with a junior user researcher over 7 sprints, we recruited participants and ran research to build evidence for the service design. We used different methods including phone interviews, face-to-face, lab sessions and pop-up interviews at a teaching event.</p>

   <p>We spoke to 111 eligible users and using a hypothesis board, we mapped all the insights back to every step of the service journey. Our insights also informed iterations of the prototype across the sprints.</p>

   <h2>Orchestrating the layers of the service</h2>
   <p class="list-margin">I collaborated with:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>the service owner (a senior civil servant), a product manager and interaction designer to create a working prototype of the digital service</li>
      <li>teachers and school support staff to identify how they would enable the service and how the service design met their needs</li>
      <li>a technical architect and other ministerial departments (for example HMRC) to bring together supporting systems that would be needed. Eg. GOV.UK identity tool called Verify</li>
    </ul>
 
   <h2>Outcome</h2>
   <p class="list-margin">We delivered:</p>
   <ul>
    <li>a digital prototype of the end-to-end service with a working technology stack</li>
    <li>a hypothesis board of evidence relating to all the steps in the service design</li>
    <li>a service blueprint that detailed every step in the service in relation to user needs, actors, systems and policy criteria</li>
   </ul>
   <p>My team passed the service assessment and the service went into the Beta phase. We had excellent feedback from the client on how much we had achieved and how well we had collaborated with the stakeholders.</p>
   <p>The service is now <a class="link-color" href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/teachers-claim-back-your-student-loan-repayments">live.</a></p>
